# **PUSH-SWAP**

>The goal is to sort the stack with the lowest possible number of operations. During
the evaluation process, the number of instructions found by your program will be
compared against a limit: the maximum number of operations tolerated.

### Main points of my project:
- Sorting 100 values in under 700 operations;
- Sorting 500 values in under 5500 operations;
- Using the K-sort (simplifying data and organizing it based on a calculated range of values);
- Using array-stacks in structures;
- Checker program;
